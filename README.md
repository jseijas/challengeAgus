# challengeAgus
A coding challeng for Agustin

## Introduction
This language offer us to write a message using only 7 custom instructions

## Rules
This language works with an array of integers of indefinit size, with all values intialized to 0.
It uses a pointer referencing a table cell (initially the first).
There will be no mistakes in the provided code. Each "ro" is associated to a "cks".

## Instructions
The instructions are:
- Ba : moves the pointer to the next cell
- tt : if the pointed cell is not the first, moves the pointer to the previous cell
- le : increments the value of the pointed cell
- co : decrements the value of the pointed cell
- de : displays to standard output the character represented by the ASCII code defined by the value of the pointed cell
- ro : if the pointed cell’s value is 0, jump just after corresponding cks instruction
- cks : if the pointed cell’s value is not 0, return to the corresponding ro instruction

## Loops
« ro/cks » loops can be nested:
```
- ro
--ro
---(instructions)
--cks
-cks
```

## Exercise
Write a program that provides the string generated by the following code:
1) leleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleleledecocode
